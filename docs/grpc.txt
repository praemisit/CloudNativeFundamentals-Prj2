The gRPC technology is being used to create new location data. The respective locEvent.proto format is

message LocEventMessage {
  string creation_time = 1;
  int32 person_id = 2;
  int32 latitude = 3;
  int32 longitude = 4;
}


Sample request for this endpoint can be made by running the python script "pushTestEvents.py" in the loc-event-api pod. For detailed instruction please have a look at the project's Readme, chapter "Check gRPC and Kafka message stream to create new location data points"
